notmarkdown
===========

The multi-flavored markup language that isn't Markdown.

What is it?
-----------

Not Markdown is self-explanatory in its name: it isn't Markdown.

But, besides that, what's so special about it?
Not Markdown isn't just a markup language, it is a *flavored* markup language. That means that you can choose from a ton of different syntaxes, and all get the job done while supplying a little something extra.

- want clear, defined statements? Try the CAPS library.

- want simplicity in its finest? Try the easy library.

- want syntax so defining it's like a breath of crisp air? Try the minty library.

Besides these, there are many more possibilities, and you'll have to explore and test to find what's best.
